From our analysis, we believe GV contributes greatly to the production and distribution of narcotics in the South Manchester region. \\n\\n The street-gang has influences which stretch from its local territory in Withington, all the way towards the Fallowfield, Rusholme and Moss Side regions. It is unclear whether these are positive or negative influences. However, there is evidence to confirm that GVs relationship with the Fallowfield region is entirely negative as that area is believed to be the territory of their main rivals. There is no data to suggest that either gangs are actively trying to attack eachother. \\n\\n Despite GVs small size, the group is well-equipped with weapons like: machetes, hunting knives and potential access to lethal firearms with live ammunition. We believe that the firearms in question are replicas which have been modded to discharge live ammunition. This belief was derived from hearsay and so may not be true, but it was a recurring piece of information in our analysis. \\n\\n The gang maintains a very low profile and appears to avoid confrontation(s) in favour of gaining money by selling drugs.
